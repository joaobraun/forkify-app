## Notes

This project is based on the project created by Jonas Schmedtmann from his course. You can check the full application <a href="https://forkify-v2.netlify.app">here!</a>

## Project Info

This app displays lots of differents recipes, servings and how to cook it. You have a search input, a sidebar displaying all recipes you searched, a bookmark and also you can add your own recipes. This project uses Jonas API to fetch data, and the ```MVC architecture``` to organize the code modules. Here we used many Javascript ES6+ features, also using classes to make a better use of the architecture, the project is bundled to compress the code and also transpiled to support older browsers so that the app can run in most environments.

## Installing and Running

- <a href="https://docs.github.com/pt/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository">Clone</a> this repository.

You'll need ```node``` and ```npm``` installed locally. Then run:

```
npm install
```
This project uses <a href="https://parceljs.org">Parcel</a> to bundle the project files so you will need to build the project locally and then run the development server.
After all dependencies are installed, just run the build command:

```
npm run build
```

and then to run locally:

```
npm start
````
if done correctly you should see on the terminal the message *"Server running at http://localhost:1234"*
