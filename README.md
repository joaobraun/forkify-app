## Notes

This project is based on the project created by <a href="https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann">Jonas Schmedtmann</a> from his JavaScript course. You can check the full application <a href="https://forkify-joaobraun.netlify.app">here!</a>

## Project Info

This app displays lots of differents recipes, servings and how to cook it. You have a search input, a sidebar displaying all recipes you searched, a bookmark and also you can add your own recipes. This project uses Jonas API to fetch data, and the ```MVC architecture``` to organize the code modules. Here we used many Javascript ES6+ features, also using classes to make a better use of the architecture, the project is bundled to compress the code and also transpiled to support older browsers so that the app can run in most environments.
